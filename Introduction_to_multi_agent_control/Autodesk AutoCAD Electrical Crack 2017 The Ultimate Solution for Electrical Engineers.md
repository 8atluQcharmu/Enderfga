# Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2017: A Review of the New Features and Benefits
 
Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical 2017 is the latest version of the software that helps electrical engineers and designers create and document electrical controls systems. It offers many new features and benefits that make it easier, faster, and more efficient to design and document electrical circuits. Here are some of the highlights of what's new in AutoCAD Electrical 2017:
 
- **SQL Server Support:** Starting with AutoCAD Electrical 2017, you can use SQL Server for your catalog data, instead of the default Microsoft Access-based databases. This allows you to store and access larger amounts of data, improve performance and security, and share data across multiple users and projects[^3^].
- **Location View Tab on Project Manager:** You can now use the Location View tab on Project Manager to view and manage your project drawings based on their assigned location properties. You can also create location labels, reassign drawings to different locations, and generate location-based reports[^3^].
- **Improved Circuit Design:** You can now create and edit circuits more easily with enhanced features such as Circuit Builder, Edit Wire Sequence, Insert Wires and Ladders, and Copy Circuit. You can also use the Circuit Clipboard to copy and paste circuit data between drawings or projects[^3^].
- **Enhanced Panel Layouts:** You can now create panel layouts more efficiently with improved features such as Panel Layout Symbols, Terminal Strip Editor, Insert/Edit Component, and Align/Space Components. You can also use the Panel Footprint Extractor to extract footprint data from panel layout drawings[^3^].
- **Updated Standards Support:** You can now comply with the latest industry standards with updated libraries and templates for ANSI, NFPA, IEC, JIC, GB, AS/NZS, and more. You can also customize your own standards using the Symbol Builder, Icon Menu Wizard, and Catalog Browser[^3^].
