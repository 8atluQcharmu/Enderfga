Niebels Methods Standards And Work Design is a popular textbook that was first published in 1974 by Benjamin W. Niebel, a professor of industrial engineering at Pennsylvania State University. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and practical introduction to the principles and techniques of industrial engineering, with an emphasis on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of work systems. The book has been revised and updated several times over the years, with the latest edition being published in 2013 by McGraw-Hill Education. The 13th edition of the book has 118 pages and is divided into four parts:
 
- Part I: Methods Engineering and Operations Analysis. This part covers the basics of methods engineering, such as process analysis, operation analysis, motion study, micromotion study, therbligs, charting techniques, and work sampling.
- Part II: Work Measurement and Compensation. This part covers the basics of work measurement, such as time study, predetermined motion time systems, standard data systems, work sampling, learning curves, wage payment systems, and incentive plans.
- Part III: Facilities Planning and Design. This part covers the basics of facilities planning and design, such as plant location, plant layout, material handling systems, storage systems, and computer-aided facilities planning.
- Part IV: Ergonomics and Work Design. This part covers the basics of ergonomics and work design, such as human factors engineering, anthropometry, biomechanics, workstation design, manual materials handling, environmental factors, safety and health, and participatory ergonomics.
