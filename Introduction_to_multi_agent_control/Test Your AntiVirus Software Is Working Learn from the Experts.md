## Method 1: Use the EICAR Test File
 
The EICAR test file is a standard file that is used by the antivirus industry to test the functionality of AntiVirus software. It is not a real virus, but it contains a harmless code that mimics the behavior of a virus. The EICAR test file is designed to trigger an alert from any AntiVirus software that detects it.
 
To use the EICAR test file, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a text editor such as Notepad or WordPad.
2. Copy and paste the following code into the text editor:
`X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`
3. Save the file as `eicar.com` on your desktop or any other location.
4. If your AntiVirus software is working, it should detect the file as a virus and quarantine or delete it. You may also see a pop-up notification or a warning message from your AntiVirus software.
5. If your AntiVirus software does not react to the file, it may not be working properly. You should check your AntiVirus settings and make sure it is updated and enabled. You may also want to scan your computer with another AntiVirus software or an online scanner to make sure it is not infected.

## Method 2: Use the AMTSO Security Features Check Tools
 
The AMTSO (Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization) is an international organization that sets standards and guidelines for testing AntiVirus software. The AMTSO website offers several tools that can help you check the security features of your AntiVirus software. These tools include:

- The AMTSO Phishing Page Test: This tool simulates a phishing website that tries to trick you into entering your personal information. If your AntiVirus software has a phishing protection feature, it should block or warn you about this page.
- The AMTSO Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) Test: This tool simulates a PUA that may display unwanted ads, change your browser settings, or collect your data. If your AntiVirus software has a PUA protection feature, it should block or warn you about this application.
- The AMTSO CloudCar Test: This tool simulates a cloud-based malware that can evade traditional detection methods. If your AntiVirus software has a cloud-based protection feature, it should block or warn you about this malware.
- The AMTSO Drive-by Download Test: This tool simulates a drive-by download attack that can infect your computer without your consent. If your AntiVirus software has a drive-by download protection feature, it should block or warn you about this attack.

To use the AMTSO security features check tools, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [AMTSO security features check page](https://www.amtso.org/security-features-check/).
2. Select the tool that you want to use and click on the link.
3. If your AntiVirus software is working, it should prevent you from accessing the page or downloading the file. You may also see a pop-up notification or a warning message from your AntiVirus software.
4. If your AntiVirus software does not react to the tool, it may not support that feature or it may not be working properly. You should check your AntiVirus settings and make sure it is updated and enabled. You may also want to scan your computer with another AntiVirus software or an online scanner to make sure it is not infected.
