- As mentioned earlier, the Netflix app for PSP is not an official app from Netflix, but a fan-made one that uses the Netflix website to stream videos. This means that it may not work with some regions or titles, and it may stop working if Netflix changes its website or blocks the app. You may also encounter some errors or bugs while using the app.
- Another limitation of watching Netflix on PSP is that the video quality may not be optimal. The PSP screen has a resolution of 480 x 272 pixels, which is lower than most modern devices. The Netflix app also compresses the video stream to fit the PSP screen size and bandwidth. This may result in pixelated or blurry images, especially for high-definition videos.
- A final drawback of watching Netflix on PSP is that it may drain your battery faster than normal. Streaming videos requires a lot of power from your device, especially if you are using Wi-Fi. You may need to charge your PSP more often or use an external battery pack if you want to watch Netflix for a long time.
